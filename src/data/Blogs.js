      "Yesterday, Sunday May 14th, I awoke at 5 in the morning. In 3 hours’ time, I, along with 20 or so other friends from Global Reach Seattle, would be covered in a rainbow of powder as we ‘competed’ in this year’s Color Run. With over an hour to get ready, I energized myself with a warm shower and a bowl of hot oatmeal. Just as daylight was breaking over Seattle, I made my way to the George Washington Statue in the UW campus where I was greeted by a few groggy hey’s, ni hao’s, and ohayou’s. Most of everyone was in disbelief that they had managed to step out in public that early on a Sunday morning, and a few spent the 40-minute bus ride to the Seattle Center in sleepy denial.",
      "The Color Run markets itself as “The Happiest 5k on the Planet” and stepping off the bus at 7:30am, that statement was not lost on us. We walked past young girls (and even a few grown men #noshame) jumping around in pink and green tutus, coming upon a stage of middle-aged moms effortlessly grooving to blaring pop music (in front of a crowd that must have included a few teenagers rolling their eyes), until finally we reached the sign-in room where student volunteers handed us goodie-bags stuffed with chips, a headband and the official runners’ t-shirt.",
      "Standing in a big circle, we changed clothes, loaded up on much-needed carbs, and waited for the race to begin. At 8am, we headed out to the starting point, but not before taking an obligatory group picture. As soon as he saw the photo, one of my friends exclaimed “Dang! Look at how many of us there are. We are the Color Run!” an ‘alternative fact’ to the truth that was up ahead."
