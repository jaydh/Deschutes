      "Yesterday, Sunday May 14th, I awoke at 5 in the morning. In 3 hours’ time, I, along with 20 or so other friends from Global Reach Seattle, would be covered in a rainbow of powder as we ‘competed’ in this year’s Color Run. With over an hour to get ready, I energized myself with a warm shower and a bowl of hot oatmeal. Just as daylight was breaking over Seattle, I made my way to the George Washington Statue in the UW campus where I was greeted by a few groggy hey’s, ni hao’s, and ohayou’s. Most of everyone was in disbelief that they had managed to step out in public that early on a Sunday morning, and a few spent the 40-minute bus ride to the Seattle Center in sleepy denial.",
      "The Color Run markets itself as “The Happiest 5k on the Planet” and stepping off the bus at 7:30am, that statement was not lost on us. We walked past young girls (and even a few grown men #noshame) jumping around in pink and green tutus, coming upon a stage of middle-aged moms effortlessly grooving to blaring pop music (in front of a crowd that must have included a few teenagers rolling their eyes), until finally we reached the sign-in room where student volunteers handed us goodie-bags stuffed with chips, a headband and the official runners’ t-shirt.",
      "Standing in a big circle, we changed clothes, loaded up on much-needed carbs, and waited for the race to begin. At 8am, we headed out to the starting point, but not before taking an obligatory group picture. As soon as he saw the photo, one of my friends exclaimed “Dang! Look at how many of us there are. We are the Color Run!” an ‘alternative fact’ to the truth that was up ahead.",
      "The crowd was massive, so big in fact, that instead of having everyone run at once (which would have ensured chaos), we were instead loosely split into groups that ran in 5-minute intervals. Though the Color Run itself officially started at 8am, we weren’t give the okay to run until 8:45. However, none of us minded and we passed the time dancing to the music on loud speaker, jumping on each other’s backs, and crowding around cellphone cameras for the perfect selfies.",
      "With each step forward, the music got louder. As the starting line slowly came into view, we noticed a DJ to the right ushering and energizing everyone as they anxiously waited. Every so often he would throw things into the crowd – t-shirts, bandanas, headbands – but luck was not on our side and we missed every single throw. ",
      "“8!” the DJ shouted. Without a moments’ pause, the crowd energetically joined in. “7!”, “6!”, “5!”, “4!”. At this point we had our hands up high in the air “3!”, “2!”, “1!”. I had my cellphone out, perfectly centered to capture this moment on video. But as soon as countdown finished, any attention focused on video quality instantly shifted. One of my friends darted ahead and I quickly followed, together weaving in and out of families who had chosen a more leisurely pace. We rounded a corner and were instantly hit with our first color: dark green. I took an especially big hit of green to my right arm, waving it in excitement. ",
      "At this point, our group had fragmented and we began to slow down our pace. Though it is officially a race, the Color Run is as much about the journey along the way as race itself. We stopped, walked, ran, and took many more selfies with various configurations of friends that we could find. The next check point was a bubble bath, so to speak: bubble making machines spewed bubbles into the air as volunteers on either side cheered us onward. In fact, the bubbles were so much fun that we turned around just so we could run through the machines again. ",
      "The racecourse took us through several main streets in downtown Seattle. As I ran alongside friends and other people from the community, my eyes couldn’t help but wander. I live in such a beautiful city, I thought in awe. We spent the rest of the race sprinting in bursts, doing a lot more walking that we had originally planned, and of course, taking tons of pictures.",
      "As the end neared, I realized that most of the green powder from the start had fallen off and I had yet to be hit by any more. What happened to all the colors? Suddenly – BLAM. Yellow. BLAM. Blue. BLAM. Pink. I had crossed the finish line and ran through an endless cloud of powder given fuel by a line gleeful volunteers. ",
      "Everyone who finished was then given a participation medal and a packet of colored powder (I received a blue one). Those of us who had finished first took turns inconspicuously dumping powder on recent arrivals from our group. By the time the powder settled, everyone was covered in various shades of rainbow.",
      "This was my first Color Run, and in fact, my first ever Run. I didn’t know what to expect going in. I had a month to train, I got this. Okay, 2 weeks now, there’s still time. Shoot, it’s tomorrow and I don’t have any time left to train. I had been worried that I would be underqualified, but as I left the Color Run, my blue colored lips were open in a wide smile. I had so much fun and I was so glad to have the opportunity to share this moment with so many friends from Global Reach Seattle!"
