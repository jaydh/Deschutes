    'introduction': 'Hi, I am Daisy (Yaohan Di), an exchange student from the University of Tokyo. I am a Chinese and went to Japan after I graduated from high school. I major in International relations and I am a junior now. I also went to Okinawa (a beautiful island of Japan) during my high school as an exchange student. Studying abroad can be both exciting and frustrating. Getting used to a new culture and environment and making new friends there are always difficult for international students with the language barrier and cultural differences. Here in Seattle, I fell so lucky to meet the lovely and awesome guys who share the same feeling with me and are also willing to help other international student to get connected in Seattle. I would like to share my experience and help more international students like me, to be their first step to the wonderful life of Seattle. So I joined GRS, hoping we can bring more courage, confidence and opportunities to international students.'

    'introduction': 'Francis was born on the East coast of America in rural pennsylvania, but was raised in seattle since the beginning of elementary school (if you have any questions regarding good places to eat, or things to see in the Seattle Area he’s the one to ask). Despite being 19, he loves to travel and to this date has been to 9 countries including China, India, Belize, Guatemala, Italy, France, England, Germany, and Portugal, (10 if you count canada); and has a bucket list of many more places he would love to go such as Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Greece, Morocco, and Singapore. He is a freshman at UW, bottom of the ladder, and has begun studying international studies through the Jackson School. Francis is a very energetic and ecstatic individual who some might say is a bit eccentric, but nevertheless funny, enjoyable to be around, and quite unpredictable. He is the mood setter, and is almost always the person who brings energy into the room. He is an extremely social individual who has worked hard to expand his social network, and establish connections with officers of many of the cultural clubs around the campus. He loves meeting new people, making new connections, and working with other people, bringing his imagination and fresh mind to the table. Francis has a lot of hobbies, but there are a few things he loves to do more than anything else with his free time. Francis LOVES music, and through that love he also discovered a new passion for dancing (mostly hip hop, popping, and choreographic styles) . He played jazz for 10 years, and listens to many other types of music such as EDM, pop, soundtracks, RNB, and soul. He loves gaming, watching dramas (korean, taiwanese, and chinese for the most part), watching anime, and cosplaying.'
