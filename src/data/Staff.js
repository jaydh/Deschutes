    'introduction': 'Hi, I am Daisy (Yaohan Di), an exchange student from the University of Tokyo. I am a Chinese and went to Japan after I graduated from high school. I major in International relations and I am a junior now. I also went to Okinawa (a beautiful island of Japan) during my high school as an exchange student. Studying abroad can be both exciting and frustrating. Getting used to a new culture and environment and making new friends there are always difficult for international students with the language barrier and cultural differences. Here in Seattle, I fell so lucky to meet the lovely and awesome guys who share the same feeling with me and are also willing to help other international student to get connected in Seattle. I would like to share my experience and help more international students like me, to be their first step to the wonderful life of Seattle. So I joined GRS, hoping we can bring more courage, confidence and opportunities to international students.'
