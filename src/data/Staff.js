I’m Alex Mitu, but many people call me “Me Too.” I just recently graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Washington, where I also studied Mandarin Chinese. I’m very passionate about international relations, and in addition to my involvement with Global Reach Seattle, I also volunteer as an ESL instructor for refugees and immigrants trying to gain US citizenship and am part of an international Christian ministry. In my free time, you can find me drinking lots of tea (my favorite is Genmaicha), listening to podcasts, or endlessly browsing Reddit.'
