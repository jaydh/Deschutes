						<h2>Homestay</h2>
						<p>Pro<br/>
							Cost: homestay is sometimes cheaper way to live than living by yourself especially around
							Seattle because it includes meals, all utilities and rent. <br/>
							Cultural experiences: living with local provides you what it is like to live in the U.S. Some of
							the hosts are immigrants, and they will understand your feelings well.<br/>
							Home: you can construct a second home in the U.S. by homestay. They will welcome you
							as one of a family member, and you can feel family even your real family is far away.<br/>
							Studying: It is a good environment to concentrate on studying because you don’t have to do
							house works such as going to buy food or daily necessities, cleaning all the house, and
							making meals every day.<br/><br/>
							Con<br/>
							Rules: In many cases, the hosts make rules to live together and to make your and their life
							comfortable. You might feel too much restriction and miss free life from those rules.<br/>
							Difference of hosts: the hosts accepts foreign students for variable reasons. So it is
							unavoidable that there are difference between hosts. Some will treat you as real family and
							take care of you well, on the other hand, some accept the students as a business, so they
							don’t take care of you well or just do minimum necessary things. Your host can’t be exact
							the same as you expected.</p>

						<h2>Apartment</h2>
						<p>Living in an apartment as an international student can be difficult. You might not find any roommates,
							the prices might not be right. Apartments can be expensive, especially in the Seattle area.
							At times there may be postings for apartments around schools. One of the best ways to get cheaper
							housing is to get it together, with other people.
							Having roommates can be an exciting experience. It can also make paying for the apartments cheaper by
							splitting payments between students.<br/>

						<h2>Dorms</h2>
						<p>There are many dorms in Seattle Washington, but most of them are limited to Universities such as:</p>
						<h3>University of Washington (UW)</h3>
						<p>The Residence Hall community is a great option for undergraduate students who will be studying
							at the UW for one academic year or less. In a typical year we expect to have autumn
							quarter housing for new undergraduate students who apply for residence hall housing by May 15.
							Residence hall assignments for the upcoming quarter are made during the previous quarter.
							Autumn quarter assignment notifications are sent beginning in early August, and for other
							quarters, about a month before the quarter begins.
							Most of the residence halls are closed during winter break (from 12 noon on December 19 to 8
							am on January 3) however, you have the option to request when you apply to be assigned to an
							area that is open for winter break (Lander Hall, Mercer Court, Stevens Court). We do our very
							best to assign international students who request winter break housing to one of the winter break
							halls.<br/>

						</p>
						<h3>Washington State University (WSU)</h3>
						<h4>Focused community halls</h4>
						<p>Do you want to live with internationally focused domestic students? With science and
							engineering majors? With the University’s most dedicated scholars? In a quiet environment?
							WSU offers focused theme halls that suit your living and learning style.</p>
						<h4>GLOBAL SCHOLARS</h4>
						<p>The newly constructed Global Scholars Hall, opening fall 2015, welcomes international and
							domestic students who are interested in cultural sharing and global leadership.</p>
						<h4>SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS (STEM)</h4>
						<p>All students who plan to study science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and related areas
							are encouraged to sign up for Stephenson Hall, where you can take First-Year Focus courses that
							are closer to your area of interest and live with students who are studying in similar fields.</p>
						<h4>SCHOLARS’ HALLS</h4>
						<p>Many of the University’s most dedicated scholars choose to live in Honors Hall and Scott-Coman Hall,
							where they help each other reach new levels of inquiry and learning.</p>
						<h4>AGE-BASED COMMUNITIES</h4>
						<p>Three residence halls—McEachern, Orton, and Rogers—are set aside for students who are at
							least 19 years of age. They give you the benefits of dormitory living with a bit more quiet and
							privacy than the all-ages halls.<br/>

							strongly encouraged to share this booklet with anyone involved in their college selection process,

						<h4>Global Connections in Streeter Hall</h4>
						<p>The Global Connections Living Learning Community is sponsored by the Office of Global Initiatives, the
							College of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Social Work, and the College of Arts, Letters, and Education.
							Global Connections is an ideal community to explore global issues including culture, business, languages,
							and current events. Participants are encouraged to share about their customs, food, and language in this
							safe, welcoming environment.<br/>
							To get a better idea of what the rooms look like, check out our Streeter Hall 360
							degree panorama sample room! (Java Required)<br/>
							Each floor has a student staff member, called a Community Advisor (CA), dedicated to the success of the
							community. The CA will provide activities, monitor the building for safety, and mediate any potential
							conflicts. There is also a professional staff member, called a Residential Life Coordinator (RLC). This live-in
							professional has been educated and trained to work with the student staff to provide you the best possible
							living, learning experience.<br/>
