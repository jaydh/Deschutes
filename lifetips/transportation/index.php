									<h1>Car</h1>
									<h3>Buying a car</h3>
									<p>When buying a car you have multiple options, for starters you can purchase a new or used car.
										Used cars you can also purchase from a dealer or private party. <br/>
										When you buy a new car from a dealership they will take care of all paperwork for you,
										you will still be responsible for the title fees though. This is of course the most expensive option,
										all cars will be new models, a new 2015 Toyota Prius Two will cost you at least $23,000 from a Toyota dealer.<br/>
										For used cars you have multiple options. Dealers will also sell used and older model cars.
										A used 2006 Toyota Matrix XRS from a Toyota dealership will cost around $9,000.
										The dealership is more reliable than a private party because they are under federal regulations to provide
										maintenance checks and provide 100% accurate information about the vehicle.
										They will also take care of most paperwork for you as well.
										You will still be responsible for paperwork and title fees though. <br/>
										Buying a used car from a private party is the most difficult option but can also be the most affordable.
										A website many people use to find used cars from both dealers and private parties is Craigslist
										https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/cta. Now be careful, Craigslist is known for scams.
										Many people will buy a car thinking they got a good deal then find out the car is broken and the facts
										about the car were lies. To avoid maintenance scams have a car you are interested in get a maintenance
										check at a mechanic. This can cost roughly $100, so be sure you want to buy the car.
										Also whenever you buy something on Craigslist make sure you meet the seller in a public place at all times
										to avoid danger. <br/>
										After purchasing a car from a private party you will need to take care of all paper work.
										This can be done at a Department of Licensing office (DOL). Fill out all information needed about yourself
										and the seller. At a DOL office a Licensing Agent can help you with all legal work for your car.
										You will also need to take care of License plate information that the agent can help you with. <br/><br/>

										Washington Department of Licensing main site: http://www.dol.wa.gov<br/>
										Locations of Washington DOL offices: https://fortress.wa.gov/dol/dolprod/dsdoffices/<br/>
										Dealerships: <br/>
										Search on Google the (city) + (new/used) + (car type) + car dealership i.e Google: Seattle used Toyota car dealerships,
										there will be many results as there are many car dealerships. Sometimes they will carry only one car brand,
										some dealerships will carry multiple car brands. <br/>
										Private Parties: <br/>
										These are several listing sites for cars from private party sellers. <br/>

										Craigslist https://seattle.craigslist.org/i/autos <br/>
										Sell My Car http://www.sellmycar.com <br/>

										A permit allows you to practice driving with another individual with a valid
										Washington State drivers license and 5+ years of driving experience.
										You also will get a permit if you enroll in a drivers training course. <br/>
										To get a permit you need to 15 years old and enrolled in a drivers training course.
										The training school will provide a waiver to get your permit.
										If you do not enroll in a drivers training course you need to be 15 Â½ years old and you will need
										to take a written knowledge test at a training school or testing facility.

										to a Department of Licensing office (DOL) to fill out forms. Documents you will need at the DOL office are <br/>

										at the DOL. Also if you are under 18 years old you will also need to fill out
										the Parental Authorization Affidavit form. <br/>
										To get a Washington State drivers license you will need to first apply for a license at a DOL office,
										if you have a permit you have already done this step. If you are 16 years old you will need to have
										completed a drivers training course and passed their drive test to get your license.<br/>
										If you did not enroll in a drivers training course you will need to be at least 18 years old.
